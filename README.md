# Microarray

Summary: A means to measure or detect simultaneously the expression of a large number of genes. This is especially useful to compare the expression under different conditions, after specifying a reference DNA or RNA having the same expression level throughout. The applied methodology here, is that DNA molecules, which are pre-attached to specific locations on the array surface, hybridyze with the labelled diluted DNA or RNA sample.
