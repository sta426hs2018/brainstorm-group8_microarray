# Microarray

Summary: A technique used to measure simultaneously the expression of a defined set of genes. This is especially useful to compare the differential expression under different conditions, after specifying a reference DNA or RNA having the same expression level throughout. 
In principal, DNA molecules, which are pre-attached to specific locations on the array surface, hybridyze with the labelled diluted DNA or RNA sample.
