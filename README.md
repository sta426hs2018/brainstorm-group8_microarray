# Microarray

Summary: A technique used to measure simultaneously the expression of a defined set of genes. This is especially useful to compare the differential expression under different conditions, after specifying a reference DNA or RNA having the same expression level throughout. 
In principal, DNA molecules, which are pre-attached to specific locations on the array surface, hybridyze with the flourescence dye labelled diluted DNA or RNA samples. Indiviual expression levels are then determined by the measurement of the flourescence dye derived light intensity.
