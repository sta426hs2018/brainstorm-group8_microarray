# Microarray

Summary: A microarray experiment is a means to measure or detect simultaneously the expression of a large number of genes. This is especially useful to compare the expression under different conditions, after specifying a reference DNA or RNA having the same expression level throughout. The expression is measured using cDNA reverse-transcribed from mRNA.
